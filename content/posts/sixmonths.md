## Six Months

Doesn't time fly, been at my new job with the DWP six months now.

Still enjoying it, learning new tools (Nomad, Pact, etc) and techinques as they say everyday is a school day.

I a major part of it is the team I joined, most welcoming and helpful bunch, looking forward to the next six months.
