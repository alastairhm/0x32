# Learning Node JS

I've started playing about with Node JS to learn it enough to modify some legacy Lambda code.

One of the tasks I set myself was to write a Joke bot for Mastodon, which work out to be fairly easy with a couple of packages.

[Dad Joke Bot](https://github.com/alastairhm/dadjokesbot) the code is only 32 lines long, looking to expand it to be able to post images as well.

The resulting posts end up here, [https://mastodon.me.uk/@dadjokes](https://mastodon.me.uk/@dadjokes)
