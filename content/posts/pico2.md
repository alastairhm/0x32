Code of this is here [https://github.com/alastairhm/pico_w/blob/main/i2c_scan.py](https://github.com/alastairhm/pico_w/blob/main/i2c_scan.py)

And also used here to display the IP address after connected to the wifi [https://github.com/alastairhm/pico_w/blob/main/wifi_oled.py](https://github.com/alastairhm/pico_w/blob/main/wifi_oled.py)

Next thing I've been playing with is internal and external temperature sensors, I will post about that soon.
