Been trying to relearn 6502 assembly language for fun, its a lot faster and easier than the first time on actual hardware when I was a teenager.

Been using a book I picked up from eBay [Discovering BBC Micro Machine Code by A.P. Stephenson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2911575-discovering-bbc-micro-machine)

Using [BeebAsm assembler](https://github.com/stardot/beebasm/) on my Mac with a BBC Micro emulator, rather than build in BBC BASIC one.

You can find my code at Github <https://github.com/alastairhm/beebasm>

This example draws a line of zeros to Mode 7, see screenshot below.

```asm
\ Write characters to Mode 7 screen
\ Using Indirect Indexing
\ Using BeebASM assembler

oswrch = &FFEE
screen = &7C00+80
addr = &70

ORG &2000

.start
    LDA #7          \ Change to Mode 7
    JSR screenmode
    LDA #LO(screen)
    STA addr
    LDA #HI(screen)
    STA addr+1
    LDY #39
    .loop
    LDA #48
    STA (addr), Y
    DEY
    BPL loop

.finish
    RTS
.screenmode
    INCLUDE "../lib/screenmode.asm"
.end

SAVE "MyCode", start, end
```
