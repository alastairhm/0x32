A simple Python script to allow you to quickly search from the command line that I've been playing with on and off for a while.

[https://github.com/alastairhm/searchit](https://github.com/alastairhm/searchit)

It uses the [Python Library Fire](https://pypi.org/project/fire/) to automatically generate the command line interface which is something I stumbled across recently.

You either pass it a paramater for the search term or if one it not passed it used whatever is in your clipboard buffet.

Updating the parameter file you can add other search engines and pick which one to use as your default.

For full instruction see the repository [README](https://github.com/alastairhm/searchit/blob/main/README.md)
