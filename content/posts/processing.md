## Make learning programming fun

It is funny how things come around again, when I started learning to programming back in the 1980s on my 8 bit machines (ZX81, Acorn Electron, BBC Micro) I used to play with graphics a lot.
It gave instant feedback and visually showed the results of things like recursion.
I had great fun playing with Fractals and other procedural generated images.

Recently I discovered a YouTube channel and programming platform which took me right back to those days.

The platform is called [Processing](https://processing.org/)

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping.

They also have a number of interesting YouTube videos working on a number of things I used to hammer out in BBC Basic.
Very interesting watching, well worth a look.
