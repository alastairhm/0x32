# New Job

After nine years and nine months at William Hill I will be starting a new job next Monday.

Looking forward to the new challenge but also sad to say goodbye to my co-workers who have been on the journey with me since I started at William Hill back in November 2011.

I have certainly grown and learned a lot at my time at William Hill and am grateful for all the opportunities they provided with me to improve.
