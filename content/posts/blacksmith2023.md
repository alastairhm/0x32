Had a great day on my blacksmith course making a Ram's head fire poker at [Adrian Wood's Forge](https://www.awartistblacksmiths.co.uk/blacksmithing-courses.html), I would highly recommend it.

I went back for a second course after making a dragon coat hook last year, course which was part of my 50th birthday presents.
