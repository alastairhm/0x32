Lately, I've been obsessed with this albumâ€”it's been on repeat this morning. The melodies, the lyrics, the vibe... everything just clicks.

Hereâ€™s the album Iâ€™m talking about:

[Larkin Poe, Bloom](https://open.spotify.com/album/3j4gz6gqIxtKaW0NHAOZwc?si=tkstpLMTTxeI1j2A72GepA).


Let me know what you think! ðŸŽ§  
Do you have any albums that you keep coming back to?
