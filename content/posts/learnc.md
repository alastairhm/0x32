Came across this article of ways to [Learn C on Linux](https://opensource.com/article/22/7/learn-c-linux) which took me back to my 3rd _real_ programming job.

It was with a software house mainly working with C/C++ on Linux/ Unix and embedded systems.

My first real experience use C/C++ in a professional environment, happy days with a good bunch of geeks.

If you've never tried it before it would be a good change from more recent languages to learn C for a challenge.
