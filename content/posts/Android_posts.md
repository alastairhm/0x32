Trying to think of a way to be able to post content from my Android devices (phone/ Fire Tablet).

Basically would need just the following;

* Text editor for creating markdown for the post.
* Git to checkout, commit and push updates to GitHub.

My Travis CI pipeline would then handle the publishing.

Finding a text editor app isn't a problem there are any number of them on both Google Play and Amazon Kindle stores which could be used.

Getting an application to be able to checkout and push to a Git repo is providing more of a challenge, not been able to find a suitable application. At a push I may be possible to edit directly on the GitHub website on the Android browser.

More research required.
