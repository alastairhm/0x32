One thing that I've never got around to seriously try in my years messing around with different operating systems is [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution), other than the flavor of it your get with MacOs.

Having watch a lot of videos around it recently on YouTube by [RoboNuggie](https://www.youtube.com/c/RoboNuggie) on [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) it encouraged me to have to give it a go.

It went surprisingly well the and have tried both [XFCE](https://xfce.org/) and [Mate](https://mate-desktop.org/) desktop installs. Something that I'll look at using more of in the future as a backup daily driver.
